# ~[Deprecated] Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code~

~Includes the basic extensions to get started with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.com/) &amp; [Flow](https://flow.org/) development in Visual Studio Code.~

Considering the nr. of downloads of [Flow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/preset-flow) in comparison to the number of downloads of [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript), and also the fact that our company is using TypeScript, we decided to deprecate this extension pack.
